## Available environments for note formatting
The following environments have been established to enhance the clarity of the notes, highlight important concepts and graciously introduce additional information in the notes:
- **Theorem**: Utilized to highlight theorems, lemmas, corollaries, and similar propositions.
- **Proof**: Accompanies theorems and similar structures, providing detailed proofs when appropriate.
- **Definition**: Dedicated to defining key terms and concepts.
- **Example**: Illustrates the application of theories or definitions through practical examples.
- **Historical Note**: Offers historical context or background on the concepts discussed.
- **Note for a Mathematician**: Exposes deeper or more formal mathematical insights that may only be of interest to more mathematically inclined readers.
- **Analogy**: Provides real-world analogies to explain abstract concepts.
- **Advise**: Alerts readers to common misconceptions or critical errors.
- **Algorithm**: Demonstrates algorithms in programming and applied mathematics.
- **Summary**: Summarizes key points at the end of chapters or sections.
- **Problem**: Offers a problem or exercise for concepts that may particularly benefit from practice.
